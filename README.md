# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System that monitors network traffic in real-time and detects potential security threats.

## Features

- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: Analyzes network packets as they flow through the system
- **Machine Learning Detection**: Uses Random Forest and Isolation Forest algorithms for threat detection
- **Multi-layered Analysis**: Combines anomaly detection with supervised learning
- **Alert System**: Generates alerts with threat classification and confidence scores
- **Database Storage**: Stores alerts and statistics in SQLite database
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customizable detection sensitivity and alert parameters

```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishanthselvakumar1302/network-ids
   cd nids-project
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_nids.sh
   ./setup_nids.sh
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source nids_env/bin/activate
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python nids_main.py
```

### Configuration

Edit `nids_config.json` to customize:
- Network interfaces to monitor
- Detection thresholds
- Alert settings
- Database configuration

### Running as a Service

To run NIDS as a background service:

```bash
nohup python nids_main.py &
```

## Detection Capabilities

The system detects various types of network attacks:

- **DOS Attacks**: High-volume traffic patterns
- **Port Scanning**: Sequential connection attempts
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unusual data transfer patterns
- **Anomalous Traffic**: Deviations from normal behavior

## Output

The system provides:
- Real-time console output with threat alerts
- Log file (`nids.log`) with detailed information  
- SQLite database (`nids_alerts.db`) with alert history
- Performance statistics

## Development

### Adding New Detection Rules

1. Modify the `_classify_attack_type` method in `MLDetectionEngine`
2. Add new features to `extract_features` method
3. Retrain models with updated feature set

### Testing

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied**: Run with sudo for network interface access
```bash
sudo python nids_main.py
```

**Missing Dependencies**: Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Database Lock**: Stop other NIDS instances
```bash
pkill -f nids_main.py
```
